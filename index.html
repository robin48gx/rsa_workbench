<h1> Web Mastery Course : Assignment Work  </h1>

<?php echo exec('whoami'); ?>
This web site is a submission for the <b> Web Mastery </b> 
course held at Brighton University from the 15th of March to 
the 19th of March 2003.
<p>
This is the course work submission for R.P. Clark (part time student).

<h2> Course Assignment </h2>

A web based tool, to run through RSA encryption. This tool uses PHP
as a web server scripting language, which calls bash and bc scripts to
perform the mathematics of RSA. The intention is to produce an interactive 
tutorial for RSA. Each stage in key generation and encryption is shown, with
(where practical) intermediate results.
<p>
This tool allows simulations of small RSA implementations. Even
with some algorithmic optimisation to the de-cryption routines
(see <a href=maths.html> maths of large exponents)</a>. If
simulations larger than 128 bits are simulated, the de-cryption
private key parts may take several minutes to calculate.
