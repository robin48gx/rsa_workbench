<title> Algorithm used to find 'd' </title>

<h1> Algorithm used to find 'd'  </h1>

The variable 'd' must obey the equation 
<center> <b> d.e % phi = 1 </b> </center>
This can be re-written as :

<center> <b> d.e  = 1  + k.phi </b> </center>
<p>
And further
<center> <b> d  = (1+k.phi)/e </b> </center>
<p>
Iterating though with values for k, a correct value
for d is found when a whole number result for d (no fractional part)
is found.
<p>
The algorithm used is to first test the user entered value
in the form. If this satisfies the equation, it is the d value used.
If it does not, it is used as the seed value for 'k'.
If the 'd' value is left blank in the form, the algorithm
will iterate using k==1 as its start value.
<p>
Note that if the value 'e' is not co-prime to phi, 
this script may never find a valid value for 'd'.
A limit of 10,000 iterations has been placed on this for the time being.
It has been left this way to show the importance of these
numbers being co-prime, for the RSA system.
